# Welcome to Our Project!

Dear Professor Jalal Shah,

We are thrilled to present our project on **Wireless Exploitation Using Airgeddon**. This endeavor has been an incredible learning experience for us, allowing us to delve deeply into the world of wireless network auditing and penetration testing.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aimed to explore the functionalities and applications of the Airgeddon tool. We focused on various aspects, including:

- Performing deauthentication attacks  
- Capturing WPA/WPA2 handshakes  
- Conducting dictionary attacks
