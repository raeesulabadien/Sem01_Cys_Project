## 4. Demonstration of Attacking Techniques

### 4.1 & 4.2 Deauth Attack and Handshake Capture

#### Objective
Conduct a deauthentication attack to disconnect clients from a wireless network and capture the WPA/WPA2 handshake for further analysis.

**Steps**:  
1. Launch Airgeddon and check for required sub-tools.  
2. Select the appropriate wireless interface.  
3. Put the network interface into monitor mode.  
4. Access the Handshake/PMKID/Deauth tools menu.  
5. Scan for nearby networks and select the target.  
6. Start the attack to capture the handshake file.

### 4.3 Dictionary Attack

#### Objective
Crack the WPA/WPA2 password using the captured handshake.

**Steps**:  
1. Load the handshake file into the password-cracking tool.  
2. Select the dictionary attack method.  
3. Provide the dictionary file path and initiate the attack.

### 4.4 Evil Twin Attack

#### Objective
Create a fake access point to trick users into sharing their Wi-Fi password.

**Steps**:  
1. Configure Airgeddon to create a rogue AP.  
2. Use the Deauth/Disassoc attack to disconnect users from the legitimate network.  
3. Monitor the connections to the fake AP and collect authentication details.

## 5. Airgeddon Limitations

- **Hardware Dependency**: Requires compatible wireless adapters.  
- **Ethical Considerations**: Improper use can lead to legal issues.  
- **Manual Intervention**: Some tasks require manual inputs.  
- **Detection Risks**: Activities may be flagged by intrusion detection systems.

---

## 6. Mitigation (If Any)

#### Challenge
Low signal strength prevented detection of some networks.

#### Mitigation
- Used an external antenna for better reception.  
- Optimized Airgeddonâ€™s settings for extended range.
